# SelectOptionQuiz
The provided HTML code represents a simple quiz app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to answer multiple-choice questions by selecting options. It dynamically displays questions, handles user input, provides immediate feedback on correctness, and calculates the user's score. The code incorporates basic styling for a clean interface. Users can progress through the quiz, and upon completion, the app reveals their final score. This project serves as a practical exercise for those learning web development, focusing on HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic for interactivity.
